# 9x9 Tic Tac Toe with Python and Kivy


9x9 Tic Tac Toe is an engaging twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, played on a 9x9 grid comprising 9 smaller 3x3 Tic Tac Toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to win at least 5 of the smaller Tic Tac Toe boards to claim victory.

## Installation

To play 9x9 Tic Tac Toe, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from the GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ashenoy64/9x9-Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd 9x9-Tic-Tac-Toe
   ```

3. Install Kivy, the required graphical library:

   ```
   pip install kivy
   ```

## How to Play

After completing the installation, run the 9x9 Tic Tac Toe game using the following command:

```
python main.py
```

A window will appear with the 9x9 Tic Tac Toe board. To start the game, click the "Start" button. The game will highlight the smaller grid that is ready to be played.

Players take turns by clicking on the cells of the highlighted 3x3 grid to place their respective symbols (e.g., "X" and "O"). The last move determines the next grid the opponent must play.

If a player wins a smaller 3x3 grid (getting three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), it will be highlighted with a different color, indicating that the player has claimed that grid.

The game continues until one player wins at least 5 of the smaller 3x3 grids. The player who achieves this feat will be declared the winner of the 9x9 Tic Tac Toe game.
